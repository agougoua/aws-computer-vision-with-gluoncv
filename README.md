# AWS Computer Vision: Getting Started with GluonCV
I learned and passed a Coursera's certification on this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-computer-vision-gluoncv/home/welcome).

If you are passionate by Computer Vision (Image Detection, Classification and Segmentation, and more), I will suggest you to use [GluonCV](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/install.html).

In this repository, there my certificate and my contributions in differents notebooks for evaluation.
